This is the code to check your best in Flywire solution for Wordle quiz:
If you want to participate what you need to do is build a ruby file that with this method:
def solve_the_wordle(status_array: status_array)

The wordle checker will call this method until 6 times or until you will guess the right word.

Your method will get "status_array" param which will have all the previous guesses and their info.
"G" - means green and says that the letter guessed is in the right place.
"Y" - means yellow and says that the letter is in the wrong place but part of the word we want to guess.
"R" - meand red and says that the letter is not part of the word we want to guess.
For example -
the first call will have: status_array = []
the second call example will look like: status_array = [[["f", "G"], ["r", "R"], ["a", "R"], ["m", "R"], ["e", "R"]]]
the sixth call example will look like: status_array = [[["f", "G"], ["r", "R"], ["a", "R"], ["m", "R"], ["e", "R"]],
                                                       [["s", "R"], ["c", "R"], ["e", "R"], ["n", "R"], ["e", "R"]],
                                                       [["m", "R"], ["a", "R"], ["j", "R"], ["o", "R"], ["r", "R"]],
                                                       [["w", "R"], ["a", "R"], ["c", "R"], ["k", "R"], ["o", "R"]],
                                                       [["p", "R"], ["r", "R"], ["i", "Y"], ["d", "R"], ["e", "R"]]]

Your method should return a string of 5 letters.
In case the return value will not be a 5 letter string or will not be in the WORDS_DICT array, the attempt will we wasted and the next call will send an empty array:
for example: status_array = [[["f", "G"], ["r", "R"], ["a", "R"], ["m", "R"], ["e", "R"]],
                             []]

This is a contest for fun so lets try to think and build the solution on our own and not use ready solutions from the internet.
You can team up into smaller group and work on it together :-)
You are welcome to use the wordle_checker.rb and the constants.rb to test your code, this is the method that will be used to run the final competition.

When you finish send me a slack or email with your #{name}.rb file.
